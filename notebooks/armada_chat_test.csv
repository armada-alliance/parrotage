- lately I'm restarting the nodes with the 'clean' flag file on db directory to have a faster boot, skipping the chain validation...

I don't know if this has been the cause, but for me nodes start after upgrade, took 9 hours about doing chain validation 😱

- on topology node the db got corrupted with deserialization failure  message, currently restoring with last mithril snapshot and want to try to start with clean flag

- on p2p nodes i noticed that more connections get established causing too much mem/cpu usage on my 16Gm mem / 6Cores vpss

Hi all. The cardano-node-8.7.2 binaries have been posted. This update contains updated versions of cardano-node/cli and cardano-submit-api.

This version seems to be mainnet ready and it has been approved by all QA engineers. However, do wait for the official announcement before committing the updated versions for your mainnet nodes.

PSA:
The posted static binary uses ghc-9.6.3 whilst the official version is still 8.10.7. There should be some minor performance regression according to IOG. Despite that, better performance was found compared to 9.2.8. 

I have been personally using the 8.1.2 binaries built on 9.2.8 for a few months without issues. Your mileage may vary.

1834,635318013,"Hey SPOs! 👋

Today, the Input Output Global (IOG) team has successfully tagged and pre-released node version 8.2.1-pre for use on SanchoNet! SanchoNet is a new development network created to introduce the Cardano community to governance features from CIP-1694 - and to build and test together in a controlled environment, through a rolling series of regular releases.

As part of the team's commitment to releasing improvements on a more regular cadence, the new release fixes SIGHUP from shutting down the node during ledger replay, while also updating CLI to 8.5.0.0. 

SPOs are **NOT** recommended to upgrade their nodes to this version on mainnet. If you would like to test 8.2.1 against your infrastructure beforehand, you may do so in the preview and pre-production environments. You can find the full release notes in GitHub here: https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/tag/8.2.1-pre 

As usual, we invite you to log any node-related issues you may encounter in IOG’s node repo here: https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/issues.
